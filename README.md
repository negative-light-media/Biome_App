# Minecraft Biome Visualizer

## Project Goals

This project aims to create an interactive web application using Streamlit for visualizing the complex biome distribution in Minecraft, particularly focusing on the 1.18 update. The primary objectives include:

- **Data Representation**: Effectively represent the multi-dimensional biome data (temperature, humidity, continentalness, erosion, weirdness) in a user-friendly format.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Utilize tools like Matplotlib or Plotly to create dynamic, interactive visualizations that allow users to explore how different parameters interact to form various Minecraft biomes.
- **User Engagement**: Implement interactive elements such as sliders, dropdowns, and input fields to enable users to customize their data view, exploring specific biomes or parameter ranges.
- **Insightful Analysis**: Provide contextual information or analysis to help users understand the biome characteristics and the interplay of different parameters.
